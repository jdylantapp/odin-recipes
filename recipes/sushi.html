    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <li>4 cups water</li>
        <li>2 cups uncooked white rice</li>
        <li>1/2 cup seasoned rice vinegar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon white sugar, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>
        <li>1/4 pound cooked crab meat, drained of excess liquid and shredded</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon mayonnaise</li>
        <li>5 sheets nori (dry seaweed)</li>
        <li>1 avocado, sliced</li>
        <li>1/4 cup red caviar</li>
        <li>1 English cucumber, seeded and sliced into strips</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons drained pickled ginger, for garnish</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon wasabi paste</li>
    </ul></p>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <p><ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients. </li>
        <li>Wrap a sushi rolling mat completely in plastic wrap and set aside.</li>
        <li>Bring water and rice to a boil in a saucepan over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender and liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes. Transfer rice to a bowl and cut in vinegar using a rice paddle or wooden spoon. Season with sugar and salt. Allow to cool to room temperature, about 30 minutes. </li>
        <li>Combine crab meat with mayonnaise in a small bowl. </li>
        <li>Place nori sheet on a flat work surface. Spread a thin layer of rice on top of nori.</li>
        <li>Place nori, rice side down, on the prepared rolling mat. Place 2 to 3 avocado slices on top of the nori in one layer. </li>
        <li>Top with 2 to 3 tablespoons of the crab mixture. </li>
        <li>Spoon 1 to 2 teaspoons tobiko lengthwise on one side of the avocado-crab mixture, and 2 cucumber strips on the other side. </li>
        <li>Using the mat as a guide, carefully roll the California roll into a tight log. Remove the rolling mat. Top roll with more tobiko, cover with plastic wrap, and gently press the tobiko into the top of the roll. </li>
        <li>Remove the plastic and cut into 6 even pieces using a wet knife. Repeat with remaining sheets of nori and filling. Serve garnished with pickled ginger, soy sauce, and wasabi paste. </li>
